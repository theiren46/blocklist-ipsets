	"info": "<a href=\"http://botscout.com/\">BotScout</a>  helps prevent automated web scripts, known as bots, from registering on forums, polluting databases, spreading spam, and abusing forms on web sites. They do this by tracking the names, IPs, and email addresses that bots use and logging them as unique signatures for future reference. They also provide a simple yet powerful API that you can use to test forms when they're submitted on your site. This list is composed of the most recently-caught bots. ",
